- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicholas, also known as Juun.
- 👀 I’m interested in networks, cyber security, software engineering and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, advancing onto PHP and Javascript. I'm also reading Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
- 💞️ I’m open to any feedback on my work in my repositories, and thank you for bearing with me since I'm self-taught and new to GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord - Juun#5387
